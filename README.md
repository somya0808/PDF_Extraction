 Here the following libraries have been used 
 # 1-> Tabula - tabula-py is a simple Python wrapper of tabula-java, which can read table of PDF. 
 You can read tables from PDF and convert them into pandas’ DataFrame. tabula-py also converts a PDF file into CSV/TSV/JSON file. 
# 2-> Camelot - Camelot is a Python library that can help you extract tables from PDFs.
# NOTE:- Camelot only works with text-based PDFs and not scanned documents. (As Tabula explains, “If you can click
 and drag to select text in your table in a PDF viewer, then your PDF is text-based”.)
